Revision history for Perl extension IO::FD.

0.1.3   Tue 15 Nov 2022 20:45:17 AEST
	- Added accept_multiple routine
	- Fixed IPv6 address corruption bug.  Not enough space was allocated
	  for IPv6 addresses. Using struct sockaddr_storage instead of struct
	  sockaddr for sizing.
	- Routines returning packed sockaddr structures now have SvCUR forced
	  to length of INET/INET6/UNIX sockaddr types. This stops
	  Socket::unpack_sockaddr_in6 for example complaining the length of the
	  SV is too long.
	- POD: Documented accept_multiple and small typo fixes.


0.1.2	Sun 23 Oct 2022 18:38:07 AEST
	- Fixed failing peername test due to 'Temporary failure in name resolution'
	- Added shutdown to IO::FD and IO::FD::DWIM
	- Fixed up XS returns
	- Removed kqueue/kevent test as it is experimental and broken
	

0.1.1	Sun  9 Oct 2022 18:42:13 AEST
	- Added thread context macros to fix failing build on threaded perl
	- Fixed IO::FD::recv bug, not updating current length of PV
	- IO::FD::recv now returns single element, like perl
	- Added test for IO::FD::send and IO::FD::recv
	- IO::FD::mkstemp returns undef for second item
		- This is a stop gap until a cross platform 'fd=>path' is implemented
	- IO::FD::mktemp  and IO::FD::mkstemp now requires 6 'X' characters for better compatibility (linux)
	- Fixed IO:FD::readline to actually work as documented.
	- Added tests for IO::FD::readline
	- IO::FD::readline now dies if called expecting a line split read
		- Works for  $/=undef   or $/=\integer only
	- Renamed some tests and other test cleanup
